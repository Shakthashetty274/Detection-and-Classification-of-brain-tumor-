# Detection-and-Classification-of-brain-tumor-
This is a ML project that detects tumor region and classifies different tumor regions


A significant use of medical imaging technology is the identification and categorization of brain tumors from MRI data. By employing powerful magnets and use of radio waves to get same image of the brain, medical professionals can identify and diagnose several types of brain malignancies with the non-invasive technique known as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
Brain tumor identification and classification typically require several steps using MRI data. Preprocessing of the MRI data is required in order to enhance image quality and remove noise and artifacts. Subsequently, the images are subjected to an array computer vision and also various machine learning techniques to identify any tumors and classify them based on criteria such as type and location.

In the context of locating and classifying particular brain regions that are impacted by tumors, this method seeks to identify the location, margins, and effect of the tumor on surrounding brain areas. It improves detection and classification results by helping to more accurately identify the divided brain regions in MRI-based brain tumor classification.
We used a potent combination of non-local means and wavelet techniques in our project to significantly improve the denoising of MRI images. The MRI data's clarity and quality are guaranteed by the efficient noise reduction made possible by the use of wavelet transform and non-local means.

Moreover, we apply our methodology to segmentation and classification using the UNet model with an emphasis on region-based analysis. The highly precise delineation of tumor areas was made possible by the U Net architecture, which is well-known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation. Tumor regions were categorized by our model into three different groups: necrosis, edema, and enhanced regions.
